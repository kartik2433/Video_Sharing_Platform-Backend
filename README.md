# Overview
- Welcome to the development of our innovative Video Sharing Platform backend, a robust and scalable solution designed using JavaScript. This project aims to create a dynamic and engaging platform where users can upload, share, and interact with videos. Built with a clear and well-structured Entity-Relationship Model, the backend manages various entities including users, videos, comments, playlists, likes, tweets, and subscriptions. Our design ensures seamless interaction and data integrity, allowing users to create rich media content, curate personalized playlists, and engage with the community through comments and likes. This project not only focuses on functionality but also emphasizes scalability and performance, laying a strong foundation for a feature-rich video sharing experience.
